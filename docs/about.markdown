# State Public Defenders Alliance

We are an alliance in EVE Online fighting for the security of the rightful Caldari lands in the contested regions of the Caldari/Gallente warzone. We represent a disparate group of corporations united with a singular goal and a singular purpose: **fuck** the Gallente!

Our alliance is structured in a unique way, with individual corporations specializing in certain roles and with leeway given to our members to choose which group serves them best. If you cannot afford an FC, one will be provided for you.

## Why Should I Join?

Do you want to liberate the people of the State from the oppressive tyranny of the Gallente?
Do you wish revenge for the genocide of Caldari Prime?
Are you a newer pilot looking to dip your feet into PvP in a safe and friendly environment?
Does the humdrum of nullsec politics bore you and make you long for something different?
Do you just **really** like blowing stuff up?

All of these and more are good reasons to sign up today!

## What Do We Offer?

- Daily alliance-level fleets
- Regular PvP content
- Regular mining content
- Education and training from experienced members
- Easy-to-use PI program
- Wormhole access for exploration and ISK-making
- A fun and helpful community

### Upcoming Features:

- Robust Ship Replacement Program
- Full-spectrum Buyback Program
- Alliance standard handout ships

## Where Do I Apply?

You can join the **SPD Public** channel ingame and our dedicated and friendly recruiting staff will be happy to help you out! You can also fill out our [application form](https://forms.gle/mUWP8YYc7SagVXwb9) to give recruiters a better idea of which corporation will be the best fit for you.

As part of the recruiting process, you will be asked to register on [our SeAT](https://seat.facwar.space). This is a standard part of any recruitment procedure that will allow us to do a simple background check. We cannot and will never use SeAT or any other tool to meddle with your character(s). We also use SeAT to manage a number of our services, such as SRP and fleet scheduling.

New members will be placed in our University program for 30 days so we can give you all the resources and help you need to get up to speed with the wonders of Faction Warfare and all the other exciting content we engage in.
